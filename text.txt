 To create a RAG (Red, Amber, Green) system using agents in Langchain, follow these steps:
 . Define the agents and their roles.\n\nIdentify the tasks and responsibilities of each agent. For instance, you may have an agent for data collection, another for data analysis, and a third for generating recommendations.\
 Determine the data and resources each agent will need. For example, the data collection agent may need access to specific APIs or databases, while the data analysis agent may require statistical libraries.
 . Implement the agents using the appropriate tools and libraries.\n\nChoose the right programming languages and libraries for each agent.
 For instance, you may use Python for data collection and analysis, and JavaScript for generating recommendations.\n\nWrite the code for each agent,
  ensuring that they can communicate with each other and with the Langchain framework.\n\nHere\'s a simple example of an agent that collects data using P
  ython:\n\nPython\nimport requests\n\nclass DataCollector:\n
      def __init__(self, url):\n
              self.url = url\n\n
                def collect(self):\n
                     response = requests.get(self.url)\n
                           if response.status_code == 200:\n
                                 return response.json()\n
                                      else:\n
                                                raise Exception(f"Error: {response.status_code}")\n\n3.
                                                 Integrate the agents into the Langchain framework.\n\nSet up the communication channels between the agents and the Langchain framework.
                                                 You can use message queues, RESTful APIs, or websockets for this purpose.\n\nImplement the RAG system logic based on the agents\' outputs.
                                                 For example, you can set up rules to categorize the data as red, amber, or green based on predefined criteria.\n\nHere\'s a simple example of how you can implement the RAG system logic:\
                                                 n\nPython\nclass RAGSystem:\n    def __init__(self, data_collector, data_analyzer, recommendation_generator):\n        self.data_collector = data_collector\n        self.data_analyzer = data_analyzer\n        self.recommendation_generator = recommendation_generator\n\n    def process(self):\n        raw_data = self.data_collector.collect()\n        analyzed',
